Installing nanconverter on kefalonia

16 January 2020 (Thursday)

# Starting point:
# https://github.com/spinicist/nanconvert

# First need to install/compi.e ITK version 4.13 -- not sure what to make when it says that it should be the development version, as that is a note from 2017

# Let's track down ITK and install...
# https://itk.org/download/
# Don't see a software package explicitly labeled "development", so downloading 4.13.2 and seeing if there is a development flag upon installation:

# Downloaded file: InsightToolkit-4.13.2.tar.gz

# The link to the ITK Software Guide was broken, but found what I think is the right document at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/itk/files/itk/4.13/.
# Downloaded file: InsightSoftwareGuide-Book1-4.13.0.pdf

# It looks like we need cmake, as it is not on this system yet...
# https://cmake.org/download/

# Downloaded file: cmake-3.16.2.tar.gz

# Looking for instructions in: https://cmake.org/install/

# Going to try the bootstrap script to install:

cd /Users/alex/Downloads/cmake-3.16.2
./bootstrap
make
make install

# That last command failed, most likely due to permission errors, trying with sudo
sudo make install

# SUCCESS!  Moving on?

# Need to decide where to install the source directory and the binary directory...is there a pre-determined answer to this? Or do I need to waste bandwidth on this?

# Per Lucy's suggestion, putting binary in /Applications
cd /Applications/

# Now running commands directly from page 12 of the guide:
mkdir ITK-build
cd ITK-build

# Except that we're just keeping the source in Downloads for now...
ccmake ~/Downloads/cmake-3.16.2

# We now have a terminal dialog...not sure if the default is what we want or not...
# I'm getting an error from Java about needing to install JDK to use via the commandline...I clicked the More Info button, which took me to a window to download and install. (https://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp)

# Which shows the following:
## Download Java for Mac OS X
## Recommended Version 8 Update 241 (filesize: 80.25 MB)
## Release date January 14, 2020 

# Looks like this downloaded jre-8u241-macosx-x64.dmg...installing that now...Seems to be successful?

# Changing CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE from (not specified) to Release (hope this isn't an unforced error!)
# Still getting java error

# Actually may be a non-issue for now...I think I was supposed "generate" (g) instead of "configure" (c)...the latter gave me an error while the former did not.
# ACTUALLY, I have to "configure" before "generate" is even an option, so, who knows?
# I'm supposed to be able to simply run 'make', but apparently the correct file was not generated, cause I just get a dumb error instead.

# Per advice at: https://www.theitsage.com/fix-java-command-line-tool-popup-mac/
# Downloaded Java legacy support at:
# https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1572
# After installing, restarted computer...
# Trying again:
ccmake ~/Downloads/cmake-3.16.2

# Build type = release seems to still be selected...hit (c) to configure...NO JAVA ERROR!  HURRAY!

# I had to (c) twice before I was able to (g)...but still no build files are being generated.
# Tried it again, and only had to (c) once before (g) option appeared...still no files are being produced though!

# James recommended using homebrew
# After installing that...

# https://blog.kitware.com/kitware-packages-on-os-x-with-homebrew/

# This appears to be OUTDATED. Sonofabitch

# Though 'man brew' shows me that '--devel' is an option to install the development version. Is this what the github install instructions were talking about?

# Having a hard time finding how to install a specific version, so, per James' advice, just going to go with current version until shit breaks.

 brew install insighttoolkit

# Seemed to run successfully

# Try to install nanconvert
cd /Applications
git clone --recursive https://github.com/spinicist/nanconvert.git;
cd nanconvert;
git submodule init; git submodule update;
mkdir -m 775 nanconvert-build;
cd nanconvert-build;
ccmake /Applications/nanconvert;


# It says I have the wrong ITK!!!

# Uninstalling and re-installing
# Also, try to find ITK validation data...

# FINALLY realized that the installation instructions were WRONG. The issue is that nanconvert is finding ITK v4.13 BUT only will work with v5.0.0! A$$holes!
